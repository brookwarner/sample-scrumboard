# Podio API sample: Scrum Board

This is a virtual scrum board that lists stories and story items as cards on a board. It collects data from the "Demo: Scrum board" pack in the App Store. There you can also see a screenshot of the scrum board.

Each card displays the title, any notes and the person responsible for the card.

You can drag a card from one state to another and the _Story Items_ app in your Podio space will be updated with the new state.

This is a simple example of how you can build specialized visual interfaces on top of Podio.

The scrum board has only been tested in Chrome and Firefox. It may look wonky in other browsers.
